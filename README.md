# Can deep neural networks fit on a 'visitkort?'

In the midst of all the hype surrounding deep neural networks I thought to myself, what's the fuzz?
It is just multiplications and sums. Inspired by some blog I read once featuring bored engineer fitting a raytracer to a 'visitkort' I decided to try myself.

# Goal

Create a neural network in less characters than fits on a 'visitkort' and has >99% accuracy on MNIST.
