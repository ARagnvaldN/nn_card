# Can deep neural networks fit on a business card?

In the midst of all the hype surrounding deep neural networks I thought to myself, what's the fuzz?
It is just multiplications and sums. Inspired by some blog I read once featuring bored engineer fitting a raytracer on a business card I decided to try myself.

# Goal

Create a neural network in less characters than fits on a business card.
